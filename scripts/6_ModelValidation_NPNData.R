# Placeholder script for validating Arb GDD prediction w/ NPN data
# Workflow
# 1. Pull & summarize NPN individual leaf and bud burst phenometrics for Arb Species
#    1.1. Identify species in both Arb collection and NPN
#    1.2. Pull all individual phenometrics for those species
#    1.3. Clean & remove outliers
#    1.4. Save data by species
# 2. Pull associated daymet data for NPN record site-years
#    2.1. Loop through sites (since possibly multiple species per site)
#    2.2. Calculate GDD and freeze values
#    2.3. Save separate site data list for each species?  Could be redundant and inefficient, but probably most flexible for piecemeal work.
# 3. Predict budburst & leafout of NPN site-years using Arb-calculated GDD threshold
#    3.1. Loop through species, calculate leafout/budburst **w/ uncertainty** at each site; save mean, median, 95% CI.  
# 4. Calculate model evaluation metrics: 
#    4.1. Uncertainty-based metrics: % outside of confidence bands
#    4.2. Single-value based metrics: R2, RMSE, bias
#    4.3. Analysis/Interpretation of Model Performance:
#         - Is there a latitudinal or climatic gradient of fit metrics?
#         - If so, can we describe the process to bias-correct our predictions for nonstationarity? (probably not because we won't have it for all of our species)
