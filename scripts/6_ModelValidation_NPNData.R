# Placeholder script for validating Arb GDD prediction w/ NPN data
# Workflow
# 1. Pull & summarize NPN individual leaf and bud burst phenometrics for Arb Species
# 2. Pull associated daymet data for NPN records
# 3. Predict budburst & leafout of NPN site-years using Arb-calculated GDD threshold
# 4. Calculate model evaluation metrics: R2, RMSE, bias
#    - Is there a latitudinal or climatic gradient of fit metrics?
#    - If so, can we describe the process to bias-correct our predictions for nonstationarity?
#      (probably not because we won't have it for all of our species)
